{Over the years not many Ealing players have come away with any tangible
reward for their efforts when facing Colin Crouch on board 1.} 1. d4 Nf6 ({
First a little history of the Blackmar-Diemer Gambit.} 1... d5 2. e4 dxe4 3.
Nc3 $1 {Diagram # It was Dr Ryder who first played the move 3.Nc3. Armand
Blackmar, the American inventor of the gambit always continued 3.f3 and his
analysis  was published in 1882. Unfortunately the counter 3...e5 has thrown a
shadow over Blackmar's idea because Black has excellent open lines without
material disadvantage.} ({Here's an example.} 3. f3 e5 $1 {Diagram #} 4. dxe5

{Diagram # This was Ryder's preferred way but 40 years later Emil Diemer
developed the system with 5.Nf3 and it was his determined championing  that
popularised  the gambit.}) 2. Nc3 d5 3. e4 Nxe4 {Diagram # This is the Huebsch
Gambit.   Tim Sawyer in his excellent book on the Blackmar-Diemer Gambit says
that the exchange of knights helps both Black and White. Black because it
brings him one move nearer to an endgame with an extra pawn and White because
the valuable defensive knight on f6 has disappeared.} 4. Nxe4 dxe4 5. Bc4 Nc6
6. c3 Qd6 $1 {Diagram # This is worth an exclamation mark of approval. A major
problem for Black in the Blackmar-Diemer Gambit is though his position appears
sound with no pawn weaknesses, White has a long term space advantage enabling
him to build up his attacking forces. Very often Black runs out of defensive
resources and is overwhelmed by White's attack. The early deployment of
Black's queen sets up a quick counterattack against White's centre and as in
this game envisages a switch by the queen to g6 where it threatens White's
kingside.} 7. Ne2 $146 {Looking through two million games of over-the-board
and correspondence games I could only find three previous games with this
sequence of moves and each of the White players continued 7.Qb3, so played now,
the move 7.Ne2 appears to be a novelty. No doubt  in one of the BDG
enthusiasts' clubs it has been played and analysed!} (7. Qb3 Nd8 ({RR} 7... e6
